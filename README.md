# **DigitEyes**
This Java software is designed to extract digits from handwritten images. It includes a simple user interface where users can select an image containing handwritten digits, and the software will display the extracted digits as output.

## Features

1. Handwritten digit extraction using Sobel algorithm for edge detection.
2. Decision tree algorithm for digit classification.
3. User-friendly UI for easy image selection and output display.

## Dataset Used for Training

The model was trained using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 handwritten digit images. You can find the MNIST dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
- Compile and run the MainWithUI.java file.
- Select an image containing handwritten digits using the UI.
- The software will process the image and display the extracted digits as output.

## Requirements
1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
2. Any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) or text editor
3. MNIST dataset (optional for training)
