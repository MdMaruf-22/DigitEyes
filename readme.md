DigitEyes-A handwritten digit recognition tool.

This software will extract a handwritten digit from an image and show it to the user as a digital format. The image can be black and white. Even the background color and the color in which the digit was written can be different.
I used mnist dataset.Though i didnt use the actual dataset which contains 60,000 data(6,000) each. But here I took only 100 data for each digit consisting of total 1000 datas.
Link of the mnist dataset( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv ).Feel free to update and train the model for better accuracy.
